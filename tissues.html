            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
              This project was my <b>first time working with veneer and doing traditional woodworking</b>! 
              I thought it would be cute to create a custom tissue box using some scrap around a 
              makerspace.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, I traced a screenshot of the Google dinosaur game in Illustrator to create 
              the shapes I wanted to cut out. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/tissue/dino.svg" class="portfolio-img" alt="">
            <p>
              Typically veneer cutting is done using a technique called double bevel marquetry, in which 
              a knife cuts two layers of veneer at once. 
              Because of the geometry of the layout, the piece of veneer on the bottom fits perfectly
               into the space left behind by the top piece, with incredible tolerances.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/tissue/veneer.png" class="portfolio-img" alt="">
            <p>
              Unfortunately, I didn’t have access to one of these machines, so I had to laser cut
               my veneer. The kerf loss during the lasering process was minimal though, so I didn’t
                mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After laser cutting my veneer, I mixed and matched the different shades of wood to 
              maximize contrast on each side. I then glued the veneer onto plywood squares and then 
              vacuum formed them to ensure good contact and constant pressure. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/tissue/glue.png" class="portfolio-img" alt="">
            <p>
              <br>
              After a day of drying, I pulled the squares out and sanded off excess glue with a belt sander. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The top piece needed a slot for the tissues to come out, so I <b>CNC milled</b> one and then 
              rounded it out with a <b>handheld router</b>. I finally sanded each face of veneer with a 
              handheld sander to ensure the pieces were flush.
            </p>
            <p>
              Afterwards, I cut each side of each square at a 45-degree angle with a miter saw, then
              glued and clamped up all the pieces together to form a box. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/tissue/layup.png" class="portfolio-img" alt="">
            
            <p>
              <br>
                However, it was at this
                stage I realized I sanded too much away from the edges, since the edges of each box 
                were not lining up, creating gaps between the corners. No matter, woodworking is all
                 about hiding your mistakes! To add my final detailing on the edges of each side, I 
                 miter sawed away the corners and then glued in small edges in dark wood. Finally, I
                  sanded the whole thing again and applied some finish. I really like how it turned out!
            </p>

              <br>
              <b>Side note</b>: Woodworking is absolutely fascinating and incredibly dense. There are 
              so many considerations (grain density, ring size, grain direction, tensile strength, etc.)
               which make working with wood different each time, and it truly brings an appreciation in
                craftsmanship to all the woodworkers out there. (Oh, and for mass manufacturing. If you
                 haven’t seen <a href="https://youtu.be/eF5LVBW1vl8?t=116">plywood manufacturing</a> 
                 already, you should check it out, because it is insane. You’re literally rolling 
                 apart a tree and then gluing up the parts in different directions to minimize the effects of expansion.)
