              <h2>About this project</h2>
              <p>
                For 2.007, Design and Manufacturing I, students are tasked with building a 12”x12”x16”
                 robot capable of scoring as many points as possible on a game board. All components
                  are manufactured from raw stock of aluminum and delrin, teaching students skills such as turning on a lathe, milling, tapping, circuits, and drill pressing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The robot is driven by two speed servos in continuous mode. When plugged into an RC 
                communicator, these can be remotely controlled via skid steering.  
              </p>
              <p>To ensure a tight turn radius for maneuverability, I turned two delrin nubs on the
                 lathe. Unlike wheels, which skid around, these nubs would scoot along the floor of 
                 the game board with low friction, enabling the robot to turn in place.
              </p>

              <p>
                My biggest module was a linear sliding lift which completed the “beaver lift” task worth 
                the most points. For my first prototype of this module, I developed a belt system linking
                 several linear slides. These slides were produced by cutting slots into box aluminum, 
                 and fitting milled delrin sliders inside the slots. The delrin had tapped holes which
                  allowed me to mount the delrin to one of the aluminum bars, while allowing the other
                   bar to slide by freely. Deburring the aluminum sliders and testing tolerances were key 
                   in this design process to get the prototype sliding properly. This was my first time
                    machining for a larger project, and I had a great time with it, working long nights
                     in shop.
              </p>

              <video controls="controls" height="400" muted>
                <source src="assets/img/portfolio/2.007/IMG_9762.MOV">
              </video>
              <p>
                Though this system was very fast at lifting, I eventually changed my design due to issues
                 skipping on the timing pulleys despite my efforts to tension the belts. My new design, 
                 however, took advantage of the majority of the parts I had machines for the slides 
                 themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                My new lift design was a continuous lift using strings attached to a winch. As the winch
                 was wound by a high torque motor, the string would shorten, raising the lift. Using the
                  speed-torque curves for each available motor, I was able to maximize the speed at which
                   the heavy beaver could be lifted, which was important since additional points were 
                   granted for accomplishing tasks first and the rounds were only 2.5 minutes long. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I also wanted to be able to push both the upper and lower buttons on the game board 
                using my lift, but since I planned on executing the beaver lift first to maximize points,
                 this meant I also needed the lift to be able to lower back down. In order to accomplish
                  this, I attached rubber bands between each set of slides. The rubber bands would pull
                   each slider towards one another, getting rid of any slack in the string and compressing
                    the lift. That way, when the servos were spun the other way, the string would feed 
                    back in and the lift would lower.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to support the lift, I created a baseplate below the main chassis of my vehicle.
                 By inlaying the lift inside the chassis, this lowered the center of mass of the vehicle,
                  which would improve stability on turns and prevent tipping on the ramp. Nonetheless, 
                  because the lift is inherently top-heavy, I found it was necessary to add fins to the 
                  base of the robot to act as a “foot” when climbing the ramp. This extended overall 
                  footprint of the robot and (????? insert something). 
              </p>
              <video controls="controls" height="400" muted>
                <source src="assets/img/portfolio/2.007/IMG_9792.MOV">
              </video>
              <p>
                Ultimately, I advanced to the semifinals round and placed in the top 10% of robots. 
                I really enjoyed machining my robot (even though it was incredibly laborious work).
                 This was a very comprehensive experience in the design process, with near constant 
                 prototyping, which I found to be a very fun hands-on application of my learning.
