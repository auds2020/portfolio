            <h2>About this</h2>
            <div class="row gy-4">
              <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>I've recently gotten into leatherworking! It's a super interesting material to work with. My first project was a small case for my chasing tools. I forged these chasing tools in carbon steel to use in my chase and repoussé metals projects. To see more about my blacksmithing projects, see this <a href="metalsmithing.html">page</a>!</p>
                <p>I first began by cutting out the rough shape of the leather with a utility knife, using a paper template to scratch in lines to trace along. 
                  The "pocket" section first had to be wet-formed to maintain its shape. You simply get the leather wet,
                   then clamp it between a 3D-printed 2-piece mold to hold it in shape as it dries. After my two pieces were ready, I stamped my name into the front piece using a hammer and stamp.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Afterward, I glued the two pieces of leather together in place using rubber cement. This glue would prevent the 
                  leather from sliding around while I chisel the holes in for the stitching. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  From there, I used fork-shaped <b>leather chisels</b> and a hammer to punch holes through both layers of leather. In order to maintain proper 
                  spacing, I overlayed the last "prong" of the fork into the previous hole left by the chisel instead of eyeballing the distance between holes. 
                  Around the corners of the pouch, I switched from the 4-prong leather chisel to a 2-prong chisel to get a tighter radius.
                </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                  After punching the holes, it was time to stitch! I used what is called a <b>saddle stitch</b> so that even if one side of the string broke, the leather would 
                  still be held in place. Leather stitching uses special waxed thread to keep the string from fraying. Even with heavy-duty leather needles, it was tough to push the 
                  needle through at times, and I ended up breaking three needles in the process! To finish off the stitching, I cut the string and melted the wax with a lighter so that it would melt together 
                  with the previous stitch and stay secured.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I then trimmed the edges of the leather to the final dimensions I wanted again with the utility knife, then used a leather beveler to remove the rough corners. Afterwards, I <b>burnished</b> the edges to make the edges smooth. This process involves rubbing in burnishing gum (which is a sort of paste) 
                  using a burnishing tool, a wooden tool with indents to apply friction to the edges of the leather.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, I added a grommet to clasp the pouch shut. After applying leather balm to finish, the pouch was done!

                <p>Part of MIT Arcturus’ mission is to share our technology with the MIT and Boston/Cambridge community through <b>outreach programs</b>. 
                  Because we often showcase our work at MIT, it’s very common for us to meet both those who have never heard
                  about autonomy and people who have been studying for autonomy for most of their life in the same afternoon, 
                  so we work hard to cater to all levels of background knowledge during our outreach events.</p>

                <p>In January 2024, I ran a leatherworking workshop to teach other students at MIT and expand access to free leatherworking tools. I made two more projects that month: a new wallet and a sheath for the knife I <a href="metalsmithing.html">metalsmithed</a>.
                </p>
                <p>In order to do this, I needed to source two different thicknesses of leather since I wanted the wallet to be slim in my pocket and the knife sheath to be thick enough that it wouldn't get cut by the knife itself. 
                  I ended up selecting 2-3 oz leather for the wallet and 5-6 oz leather for the knife sheath.</p>
