            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
              During my internship at the University of Melbourne, I got to use their <a href="https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/addf/research/clay-3d-printing">one-of-a-kind
               clay 3D printer</a>. (There are a few other printers around the world which print concrete,
                but to my knowledge this is the only one that prints clay.)
            </p>
            <p>
              First, I created a path for the tool to follow in Rhino. Then, using a Grasshopper 
              script, I could control the speed and layer height, among other factors which control
               the robot. After packing clay into a tube and sealing it with an O-ring, the machine
                is able to deposit a steady stream of clay. The lead screw pushes up a ram into the
                 clay, extruding it. Then the robot pick and place arm follows the path set out while 
                 extruding, spiraling upwards to create layers. We actually printed onto cutting 
                 boards for ease of transportation.
            </p>
            <p>
              After letting the clay air dry for a few days, you can send it off to get fired! 
              Here are just a few of the prints I designed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This one was probably my favorite. Because the angle of the helix matched the layer height of the clay, this one looks
               woven on one side and wavy on the other! 
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn’t the first time I’ve worked with ceramics; in January 2022, I took an intro
               pottery class at MIT, and found that turning bowls is way more difficult than it looks.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this is the first time I’ve made something ceramic where though the entire piece
                 fuses together as one, it isn’t made as one smooth piece. As such, I had to worry 
                 about the materials expanding in odd ways, which was very interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I thought it was a really unique experience to try out clay printing!
