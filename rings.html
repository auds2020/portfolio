              <h2>About this project</h2>
              <p>
                I like designing rings! This series of rings was created in Rhino over the course of 2
                 weeks or created in the Zbrush in VR at the University of Melbourne’s next lab. and 
                 then 3D printed in Formlabs castable wax. The wax casts were then investment casted 
                 in various metals, including bronze, brass, and silver. Typically wax resins have
                  issues with casting as they leave behind residues which create voids in final casts, 
                  but these rings were so small that this effect was minimal. The Formlabs resolution 
                  was very impressive, with printed engravings 1 mm deep still appearing in the final
                   investment cast. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I also made a wood ring on the wood lathe. I first drilled a hole in the wood to my ring
                 size, then I created a jig to hold the ring stationary so that it wouldn’t spin in 
                 place on the ring. I did so by first turning a nub, then splitting the circular cross
                  section into quarters by making two cuts with a saw. I then rotated the block of wood
                   onto the jig, pushing towards the base until it no longer could be hand spun. With
                    the piece friction fit onto the jig, I was able to turn the square piece into a 
                    round ring. This step actually took several tries with different pieces since the
                     wood grain is actually very delicate across one direction, and a thin round piece 
                     would be subject to very high stress. As a result, I had two rings snap in half
                      during this step. On the third try, I managed to make myself a cylinder of wood,
                       which I then parted into a smaller ring and then chamfered the edges. After 
                       twisting the piece back off the jig, I hand sanded it to fit my finger better and
                        remove any rough edges, and then applied finish. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I would advise anyone else attempting this project to apply epoxy or other watertight
                 sealant to the outside of their rings, since wood expands when it soaks up water,
                  which caused it to get stuck on my finger one time after washing my hands!
