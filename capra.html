            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
              This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Capra Robotics, an outdoor mobile robot 
              startup company in Aarhus, Denmark! We built a gimbal and lift for a hyperspectral camera
               to go on top of the robot. The idea is that the mobile robot could drive through orchards
                or vineyards at night, when nobody is around, and then take pictures of the fruit and 
                use GNSS to tag each plant. This would let farmers know if they are ripe or have signs
                 of mold or disease so they would know which crops need more attention or need to be 
                 removed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on electronics, controls, and programming of the gimbal, as well as fabrication 
              and assembly of both the lift and gimbal. I also created a ROS2 node to enable serial 
              connection to the gimbal motors, which would output encoder and IMU values and enable 
              positional control. Because our internship was only 8 weeks, we designed everything to be 
              3D printed or purchased off-the-shelf. This added a unique challenge to designing and manufacturing 
              our project, since the camera itself wasn't light, and it'd move quite a lot while driving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our gimbal could move in the pitch and yaw, allowing the camera to aim at targets. Because sunlight would 
              interfere with our hyperspectral images, we decided to deploy the robot at night, so it needed to have lights 
              mounted on-board to light the fruits. Because the field of view of the hyperspectral camera was so small, we 
              also decided to add a Realsense RGB depth camera so that the robot would be able to "see" more before narrowing in on a bunch of grapes. 
              We also added several interesting elements to our design to improve its stability, protect its electronics and lenses, and make 
              controls as easy as possible. Click around below to see them all!
            </p>
            <p>
              The vertical lift was made of a linkage system controlled by a linear actuator. 
              The holes in the 40x40 aluminum extrusions and flat plate aluminum were milled to ensure 
              colinearity. The black pieces are 3D-printed at high infill (80% to 100%) to improve 
              rigidity. Finally, the entire assembly is mounted to a wooden plate and onto the robot’s 
              cover. In order to control the lift from the remote control, we use a 2-channel 
              switch connected to the receiver, which we can then use to trigger the linear actuator
               using its controller. The height of the whole assembly could be reported back using a potentiometer
                attatched to the lift via linkages.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to power it all, we pulled power from the robot itself, taking care that the overall power draw of all the devices running 
              simulataneously wouldn't overload it. We had two DC-DC converters: one which would always be on as long as the robot was on, and one "safe power" 
              which would turn off when you hit the emergency stop. 
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of our internship, we went to Kimesbjerggaard Vingård, a vineyard in the 
              countryside, to test our robot! We were able to remote control the robot, gimbal, and
               lift successfully and take some photos. This is a visualization of the hyperspectral data. 
               The eight images you see radially are the first-order diffractions, and the middle one is the weighted average of these diffractions.

              Working at Capra Robotics was an amazing opportunity to try out working at a startup 
              and explore a new country. I was able to guide my own project and move at my own pace,
               applying my knowledge of electronics, programming, and mechanical engineering all at 
               the same time. It was a great combination of things within my comfort zone that I had
                prior experience with and new things I’d never done before. Capra was great at giving 
                us help with elements we were unsure about and plenty of freedom to guide our own project. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I really enjoyed living in Denmark, which was a wonderful change of pace with beautiful 
              scenery. It was awesome to explore Aarhus with its well-connected public transport. I 
              definitely understand why it’s one of the happiest countries in the world!
