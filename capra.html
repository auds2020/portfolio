            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
              During the summer of 2022, I worked at the University of Melbourne’s robotics lab on 
              their mobile robot system as a part of MISTI-Australia (MIT’s international study/work
               abroad program). We built a driven car with a robotic arm attached for construction
                applications. The purpose of our research was to investigate how robots, and more 
                specifically mobile robots which can go around the site, might help in construction
                 applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
              At the start of my internship, I helped finish up the build of the mobile robot itself 
              and made it safe for the public. I then helped program the robot’s path-planning and arm
               motion, making sure that the robot could navigate the space and perform tasks using its
                attached arm. At the end of my visit, we demoed the robot building gardening boxes at
                 the university’s Open Day!
            </p>
            <p>
              I took a few programming classes at MIT, which were definitely foundational in my 
              programming journey here. Without this basis, it would’ve been a real struggle for 
              me to get any real progress done on my project while also learning ROS, a new programming
               language I’ve never worked with before. It was a big jump for me to go from plug-and-play
                electronics to wiring and programming robotic systems from scratch. I learned a ton 
                about applying packages and transforming existing code to suit your needs. I also have
                 never really worked much in simulation before, so it was really cool to see my robot’s
                  digital twin on the computer to verify the real robot’s behavior. This simulation 
                  element was super important since the robot itself isn’t something you’d want 
                  behaving unexpectedly; after all, the entire robot weighs well over 300 kilograms!
            </p>
            <p>
              This was by far the largest project I’d ever worked on. It forced me to think about the
               pragmatic bits of engineering — adding emergency stops, reducing noise, adding safety 
               features when people are detected. In this way, I learned that my designs never really
                operate in a vacuum, and that the harsh reality of building a project from start to 
                finish is a whole lot of Googling and troubleshooting. This experience taught me what
                 it takes to build such a large project from scratch in collaboration with others. It
                  was an awesome experience working at the Melbourne School of Design, and I can’t wait
                   to take the skills I’ve learned to my next class or job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participating in a MISTI exchange was an incredible opportunity to both learn technical 
              skills and experience a culture away from home.
